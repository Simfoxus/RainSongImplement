# RainSongImplement
Reimplements the Rain Song Guitar from a newer version of Terraria that TModLoader isn't caught up to yet. Currently, it only plays one note. It doesn't do any damage, and you only need ten dirt blocks to craft it. 

This is my first mod, so if you have any recommendations for what I should add to this, DM me on Discord! (Sim#1276)
